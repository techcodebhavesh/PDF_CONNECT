## Create new materials via ZCML


-----

## ZCML Overview & Purpose

#### Transaction for creating material master logistics views with a streamlined process.

 Value proposals gathered from

 � Tyco Electronics Data warehouse (TED),

 � Transfer Pricing Excellence database (TPEX),

 � Material Master Default Values custom table (ZMMDEFAULT),

 � User Parameters (PIDs) and

 � MRP Profiles

 User can review and modify the proposed values within a single screen.

 Standard MM01 transaction is called in the background to create the Material Master views.


-----

## ZCML Initial Screen

#### Material number

 Plant ID to create views like

##### � Sales Plant and Foreign views

 � Purchasing view

 � MRP views

 � Costing / Accounting views

 � Storage / Warehouse views

#### Sales Org and Distr. Channel to create Sales Org views

 Warehouse No. to assign a warehouse number to a material

 Purchasing Org. to assign purchasing organization for external procured materials


-----

## ZCML Initial Screen

#### You can copy

##### � defaults from an existing MRP profile

 � data from an existing material number


-----

## ZCML Source Selection

#### If the new product can be sourced by several interco suppliers available on TPEX you will be requested to select one source from the list.

 Once you selected a source from the list some data like MOQ, lead times, costs, etc. will be populated on the next screen automatically.

 If only 1 source available, pop-up screen is not shown and data is immediately used.


-----

## ZCML Sales Data

### Material and company data from initial screen

 Enter the required data

#### � some data could be already filed in

 � verify them


-----

## ZCML Purchasing & MRP Data

### Enter the required data

#### � some data could be already filed in

 � verify them

 � Purchasing

##### � No PUR View: by putting flag into it no purchasing views will be created

#### � MRP1

 � MRP2

##### � GIATP values 100

#### � MRP3


-----

## ZCML Work Scheduling & Quality Data

### Enter the required data

#### � some data could be already filed in

 � verify them

 � Work scheduling for in-house produced parts

##### � For F parts it is recommended to flag �No Work Schd View�

 � If work scheduling view needs to be created the field �Primary Mfg Bldg� needs to be maintained

#### � Quality

##### � If quality is required put flag


-----

## ZCML Accounting & Costing Data

### Enter the required data

#### � some data could be already filed in

 � verify them

 � Accounting 1

 � Costing 1

##### � P-S matl status set to 03

 � after material costing has to be removed

 � Cstg Lot Size needs to be in synch with �Price Unit�

#### � Storage Location

##### � Enter all storage locations which need to be created for material

 � At least storage locations entered on MRP1 have to be entered here

#### � Warehouse 1 if required

## Defaulting ZCML values via ZDML


-----

## ZDML Overview & Purpose

#### Custom transaction for maintaining material master default values.

 Default values proposed on the data entry screen of the ZCML transaction.

 The keys to the default value records are Plant and Profit Center.


-----

## ZDML � Create Default Values

### � Enter plant id and profit center id

 � You can maintain default values for

#### � Sales Org Views 1 & 2

 � Sales Plant Views

 � Foreign Trade


-----

## ZDML � Create Default Values

### � You can maintain default values for

#### � Purchasing View

##### � Flag would deactivate Purchasing View creation

#### � MRP1

 � MRP2

 � MRP3

 � MRP4


-----

## ZDML � Create Default Values

### � You can maintain default values for

#### � Work Scheduling

##### � Flag would deactivate Work Scheduling View creation

#### � Quality Management

 � Accounting 1

 � Costing 1 & 2

 � Storage

 � Warehouse 1


-----

## ZDML default values vs TPEX data

#### During the creation of new material for interco relationship TPEX data are retrieved for certain fields like MOQ, lead times, costs, standard pack sizes, etc.

 TPEX values will overwrite the default values defined by MRP profile.

 When TPEX values are zero or do not exist ZDML values will be copied into ZCML screen.


-----

## ZDML � Create Default Values

#### DEMO


-----

## Defaulting ZCML MRP values via MRP profile


-----

## MRP profile overview

#### MRP profile provides the ability to default values for MRP views and purchasing group to be used during the initial material master setup.

 MRP profile can be maintained via

 � MMD1 � initial setup

 � MMD2 � change existing

 � MMD3 � review

 � MMD6 � delete MRP profile

 MRP profile is 4 characters and is global usable.


-----

## MRP profile overview

#### All SAP standard MRP fields can be defaulted via MRP profile by activation of the check box in column �Default value�.

 Defined values will be defaulted into material master when MRP profile will be used during initial material master setup and can be changed afterwards.

 It is NOT recommended to use check boxes in column �Fixed Val.�

 The values will be referenced into material master fields and cannot be changed on material master but only on MRP profile.


-----

## Use MRP profile during ZCML initial material creation

#### If you create new material via ZCML the MPR profile can be entered into the field �MRP profile�.

 Using MRP profile to default values during ZCML material master creation following logic applies:

 � When TPEX value is greater than zero, copy the TPEX value

 � When TPEX is zero use MRP profile value.

 � When MRP profile value is blank use ZDML value.


-----

## Copy existing values from another material


-----

## Copy values from an existing materials

#### Creating a new material the values can be copied from another existing material.

 Data to be copied from can be specified:

 � From the same company org level, plant, sales org.

 � From different company org level, plant, sales org.


-----

## Copy values from an existing materials

#### By copying values from an existing materials keep in mind:

 � Data are copied from the source plant, sales org.

 � Data might not be appropriate for the plant to be copied to.

 � You have to review the values on ZCML screen and updated accordingly.

 � Quite risky that materials will be setup with wrong master data.
